# And Gate

The And gate outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1; otherwise, it outputs 0. It is a basic building block in digital logic.

The HDL code implements the And gate using only Nand gates. The code first computes the Nand of the inputs, then negates the result with another Nand to achieve the And function.
