# And16 Gate

The And16 gate performs a bitwise AND operation on two 16-bit inputs, outputting 1 for each bit position where both inputs are 1 else 0.

The HDL code instantiates sixteen single-bit And gates, each handling one bit of the input vectors. This creates a 16-bit output where each bit is the logical AND of the corresponding input bits.
