# Mux16 Gate

The Mux16 gate selects between two 16-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) based on a selector bit (`sel`). If `sel` is 0, the output is `a`; if `sel` is 1, the output is `b`.

In the HDL code, sixteen single-bit Mux gates are used in parallel, each handling one bit of the input vectors. This allows the circuit to switch all 16 bits at once depending on the selector.
