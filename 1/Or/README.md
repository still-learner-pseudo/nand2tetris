# Or Gate

The Or gate outputs 1 if at least one of its two inputs is 1, otherwise it outputs 0.

In the HDL code, the Or gate is built using only Nand gates by applying De Morgan's law: each input is first negated with a Nand, then the results are Nanded together to produce the Or function. The code connects these gates to realize the correct logic.
