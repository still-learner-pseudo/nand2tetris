# Or16 Gate

The Or16 gate performs a bitwise OR on two 16-bit inputs, outputting 1 for each bit position where at least one input is 1.

The HDL code instantiates sixteen single-bit Or gates, each handling one bit of the input vectors. Each output bit is the logical OR of the corresponding bits from the two inputs.
